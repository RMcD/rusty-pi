== Blinking Lights

Blinking an LED via GPIO is the Hello World of physical computing -- a
simple program that will cause some visible effect in the connected
hardware.  It will also demonstrate some more Rust language concepts,
including modules, control flow, ownership and lifetimes, I/O and 
error handling.

=== The Circuit

You will need:

 * a breadboard
 * one LED
 * one 220{ohm} resistor
 * three long female-to-male jumpers
