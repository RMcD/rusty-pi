== Filling Your Parts Bin

What to buy.  No Rust learning in this chapter.

You will need some components build the circuits in this book.

=== A Breadboard

A half-size breadboards are about the same size as the Raspberry Pi and will be plenty big enough for the circuits we will build in this book.


=== Jumper Wires

You'll need jumper wires to connect your Raspberry Pi's header to the breadboard and create connections between components on the breadboard.  You'll need female-to-male jumpers to connect the Rasperry Pi's header to the breadboard.  Other connections will need male-to-male jumpers.  Get a selection of different colours, so you can easily distinguish power, ground and control connections, and a selection of different lengths -- long ones that let you easily reach the breadboard from the Pi and short ones so that connections on the breadboard don't become a tangled mess.

=== LEDs

Coloured light-emitting diodes -- for basic output.


=== Push Buttons

Push buttons for user input.

=== Resistors

2kΩ resistors to reduce current flow through the Raspberry Pi and ensure we don't burn out it's delicate circuits.

100kΩ resistors for to pull input voltages up or down as necessary.


=== Other fun components

Don't stick with our choices.  Experiment with other components: buzzers, RGB LEDs, passive infrared detectors...
